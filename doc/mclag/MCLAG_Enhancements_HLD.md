# 1 Feature Overview

This document captures the feature enhancements of SONiC ICCP MCLAG. This includes data structure changes, MAC event handling optimizations for scaling performance, support of static MAC address over MCLAG, port isolation ACL, and traffic recovery sequencing for traffic loop prevention. 

## 1.1 Functional Requirements

### 1.1.1 Static MAC support over MCLAG
- Advertise locally configured Static MAC address to peer MCLAG node
- Withdraw MAC from peer MCLAG node when static MAC address is un-configured
- Dynamic MAC move is prohibited on Static MAC over MCLAG
- Support bridge-port isolation group for BUM control to MHD. 

### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
- Add CLI to configure MCLAG domain and corresponding attributes domain-id, local-ip-address and peer-ip-address

- Add CLI to configure optional attribute [peer-interface] 

- Add CLI to configure keep-alive timer value

- Add CLI to configure session-timeout value

- Add CLI to support addition/deletion of mclag_interfaces

### 1.1.3 Performance and Scalability Requirements
- Optimize code flow and data structures to improve scaling performance
- Support 40K FDB entries
- Support 4K VLAN's

### 1.1.4 Warm Boot Requirements
- MCLAG peer nodes should reconcile the local FDB table upon completion of warm boot, as the MAC learn and age updates from peer would be lost during the time ICCP control session is down due to warm boot.

### 1.1.5 Unique IP for supporting L3 protocol over MCLAG VLAN interface Requirements
- For VLAN's associated with MCLAG interface, allow configuration of Unique IP address on VLAN interface of Peer nodes.
- Provide mechanism for running L3 protocols such as BGP, BFD between both Peer nodes VLAN interface.
- Provide mechanism for running L3 protocols such as BGP, BFD between Peer node VLAN interface and device connected to MCLAG Client.
- For MCLAG gateway functionality (Data path) Static Anycast Gateway (SAG) or VRRP configuration will be mandatory, SAG is preferred for active-active forwarding. 

### 1.1.6 Node reboot/down handling
- Add support to notify the peer device when an MCLAG node is about to reboot..
- Add processing in Standby MCLAG node not to initiate the session down behavior while Active is rebooting.

### 1.1.7 MCLAG system MAC support requirements
- Add support to allow configuration of a user-defined system MAC value for LACP PDUs transmitted by the switch on MCLAG port channels.
- Same MCLAG system MAC should be configured on both MCLAG peer nodes.
- If the ICCP session goes down and peer_link is up, then bring down the MCLAG port channel ports on one of the MCLAG peer units. This is to avoid loops that might be caused by 2 independent switches using the same MCLAG system MAC value in their LACP PDUs.

### 1.1.8 MCLAG gateway MAC support requirements
- Add support to configure gateway MAC on MCLAG Nodes.
- Gateway MAC is updated for all VLAN routing Interfaces for which peer link is one of the VLAN member.
- Gateway MAC is independently configured on both MCLAG peers, and must be the same.
- Existing behavior of programing Active node's System MAC in the Standby node's MCLAG SVIs is the default configuration.

# 2 Functionality

## 2.1 Functional Description
### 2.1.1 Dynamic configuration of MCLAG
- Current MCLAG configuration is generated from config_db.json file with no CLI support. New CLIs will be added to configure MCLAG which includes domain-id, local ip address, peer ip address and peer_link. peer_link configuration is mandatory for Layer2 MCLAG while optional for Layer3 MCLAG.

### 2.1.2 Dynamic configuration of mclag_interface
- In the current implementation the mclag_interfaces configuration is generated from config_db.json file no CLI support is present, a new configuration command is introduced to dynamically add/delete the mclag_interfaces.

### 2.1.3 Keep-alive timer configuration
- In current implementation the keep-alive timer is hardcoded to 1 second. A new CLI command will be introduced to allow the configuration of range of values for keep-alive timer.

### 2.1.4 Session timeout configuration
- In current implementation the session time out 15 seconds after the last keep-alive messages exchange, the timeout duration is hardcoded. A new CLI command will be added to allow a configurable duration for session timeout, session timeout has to be configured in multiples keep-alive timer value. 

### 2.1.5 Static MAC support
- Current implementation does not support static MAC address over MCLAG. Static MAC information is not exchanged in the FDB TLV between the MCLAG peer nodes. Changes will be added to support Static MAC with TLV.
- Changes will be added to support the static MAC syncing from local MCLAG node to peer MCLAG node. 
- Changes will be added to handle the MAC move scenarios in presence of remote Static MAC.

### 2.1.6 Aging disable for ICCP learned MAC addresses
- In the current implementation, MAC addresses learned in the control plane from the MCLAG peer are installed as dynamic entries. Therefore, if no local traffic from these MAC addresses is seen for the ageing period then they will age out, causing a notification back to ICCPd. However if the mac is learned from peer then it will immediately re-program MAC . The result is transient flooding for the MAC and some unnecessary control plane overhead.
- When the local MCLAG node learns the MAC addresses from peer MCLAG node the type of the MAC set as dynamic. For the remote MAC addresses learned via ICCP if no traffic received on local MCLAG interface MAC addresses get age out from HW. ICCPd process the age notifications as the MAC address is peer learned re-installs MAC address back to HW.  Transient traffic flooding can occur during remote MAC re-installation. 
- The process of remote MAC aging and re-installation is repetitive causing un-necessary messaging between modules and processing. 
- To suppress the unwanted MAC age events, the new implementation programs remote MAC addresses with aging disabled. For the MAC address learned from ICCPd, FdbOrch to set new SAI attribute SAI_FDB_ENTRY_TYPE_STATIC_MACMOVE while programming, which causes SAI to not age out the MAC, but allows it to move.

### 2.1.7 Performance improvements

The following improvements are made in this enhancement: 

- Convert FDB and VLAN related linked list to binary trees to improve scaling performance
- When MCLAG node learns a new MAC address via ICCP from peer MCLAG node learned over remote orphan port, it sends a age notification back to peer to indicate MAC is locally aged, this updated is not necessary as MAC not learned locally. Avoid sending the local age notification back to peer MCLAG node each time a MAC address is learned from peer.  

### 2.1.8 Isolation group support

To control the BUM traffic towards the MHD bridge-port isolation groups is used. The isolation group is applied on the ingress side of peer-link port to filter traffic towards the MHD to avoid duplicate traffic received at MHD.

### 2.1.9 Unique IP enhancements

- Current design mandates configuring same IP address on the VLAN interface for each VLAN of which an MCLAG is a member. 
- L3 protocols such as BGP, BFD, VRRP etc cannot be configured on the VLAN interface associated with MCLAG interface because such protocols cannot address the individual routers. 
- A new configuration command is introduced for allowing separate per-peer IP configuration on the VLAN interfaces associated with MCLAG interface.
- Both same IP configuration and unique IP configuration will co-exist based on the new configuration.  

### 2.1.10 Peer MCLAG node reboot/down handling.

- Add support in ICCPd to notify the peer MCLAG node when the node is going for reload. 
- Standby MCLAG node is then aware of Active going down, and when peer session is down Standby MCLAG node does not change the system MAC to keep the traffic flowing through the Standby node MCLAG portchannels. 
- MAC and ARP information is retained while peer is rebooting for better convergence. 
- If the session is not up after peer reboot timer expiry (fixed at 5 mins) , the ICCP session down behavior is initiated on Standby MCLAG node.
- Note in case of unplanned node down situation the MCLAG down notification is not sent to peer, and peer MCLAG node handles the session down according to the session-timeout timer expiry. 

### 2.1.11 MCLAG system MAC support

- In current implementation both Active and Standby MCLAG nodes use the Active nodes system MAC address in LACP PDU's, when the user configures the MCLAG system MAC address,  on both Active and Standby MCLAG nodes configured MCLAG system MAC is used in LACP. 
- As part of the new enhancement user is allowed to configure MCLAG system MAC address .  User configured MCLAG system MAC will take precedence over the local system MAC, MCLAG PortChannels will be updated with configured MAC address.
- In case of user configured MCLAG system MAC, It is recommended to configure the MCLAG system MAC before adding the MCLAG member PortChannels to domain, to avoid one additional PortChannel flap.
- By using MCLAG system MAC in LACP , there are no changes to MCLAG system MAC for MCLAG PortChannels during session down and MCLAG member delete on the Active node, which avoids flap of PortChannels.
- The MCLAG system MAC is only used for the MCLAG portChannels , and not used for orphan PortChannels or peer_link PortChannel interfaces.
- When the MCLAG ICCP session is detected as being down by the Standby node, it brings down all the links in its MCLAG port channels. This is to avoid loops and duplicates. 


### 2.1.12 MCLAG gateway MAC support

- Before this enhancement

  In current MCLAG community design, when ICCP session is Up, Active nodes system MAC is synced to Standby node and programmed as Vlan interface MAC in both kernel and hardware.
  When ICCP session goes down, Vlan interface MAC in Standby node is changed to its own system MAC. 
  This behaviour causes traffic disruption during failover scenarios like Active node reboot or ICCP session flaps.

  In Logical VTEP deployment, Vlan interface MAC is advertised as gateway MAC in Type-5 EVPN routes. 
  During failover when Vlan interface MAC is changed in Standby Node, an updated BGP EVPN Type-5 routes should be advertised with updated gateway MAC.
  On receving updated routes from BGP, remote VTEP nodes need to reprogram routes with updated gateway MAC.
  This causes unnecessary churn in network.

- Configurable gateway MAC enhancement

  As part of this enhancement, a new configurable gateway MAC is supported. 
  Same gateway MAC must be configured in both Active node and Standby Node. 
  Gateway MAC configuration overrides default behaviour of programing Active nodes MAC in Standby node's VLAN routing interface.

## 3.3 ICCP Changes
### 3.3.1 MCLAG interface flap handling

In the current implementation, in normal operation, a port isolation filter is applied on both peers to ensure that traffic received from the peer-link is never forwarded to local MCLAG member ports. This ensures loop-free and packet duplication-free operation. Then, if all ports in an MCLAG on one peer go down (MCLAG PortChannel is down), this filter is removed on the other peer, allowing traffic destined to the MCLAG to cross the peer link, maintaining connectivity to the MCLAG. Later, when at least one member port comes back up (MCLAG PortChannel is up) on the first peer, then the filter must be re-applied on the other peer. However, this can cause transient loops if the MCLAG member ports come up before the filter is re-applied on the remote peer.

In this enhancement, acknowledgements are added to interface state notifications in ICCP, and these are used to ensure that the remote filter is applied before enabling traffic on the upcoming MCLAG member interface(s), thereby eliminating the possibility of loops and duplicates.

### 3.3.2 MCLAG configuration change handling
ICCP is extended to dynamically handle changes in MCLAG configurations. In the current implementation, MCLAG config attributes local ip, peer ip, peer interface and MCLAG interface configuration has to be done prior to bringing up ICCP docker. To handle configuration changes, MclagSyncd subscribes to CONFIG_DB MCLAG changes, saves configuration data in internal cache and notifies ICCPd. In this enhancement, Pre-provisioning support for MCLAG interfaces and peer interfaces is added.


### 3.3.3 FDB handling changes
ICCPd will be extended to support static MAC addresses, data structure changes, data type changes and MAC syncing optimizations. More details are captured in the below sections.

#### 3.3.3.1 Static MAC handling
Changes will be added to extend the current FDB TLV to notify with a static MAC flag. ICCP MAC processing will be extended for local and remote static MAC addresses handling. Local and remote static MAC move scenarios will be handled.

#### 3.3.3.2 Data structure and data type modifications
In current ICCPd implementation MAC entries are stored in linked lists which can be costly in MAC scale scenarios for lookups. The existing linked list structures will be modified to binary trees for better add, delete and lookup operations. The MAC address entry is stored as 32 byte string in the messaging and local cache, the address will be converted to 6 bytes to optimize the space messages size while syncing the MAC addresses between MCLAG peer nodes.

#### 3.3.3.3 MAC sync optimizations
When MCLAG node learns a new MAC address via ICCP from peer MCLAG node ( MAC learned on remote orphan port ), MAC address is added locally and an age notification is sent back to peer MCLAG node. These age notifications are not required to be sent, additional checks are added to stop sending such unwanted MAC updates.

### 3.3.4 Port Isolation changes
In this enhancement, the port isolation logic is updated to use [SAI Port Isolation](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saiisolationgroup.h) instead of Egress ACL. Using isolation group, unwanted traffic can be dropped at the ingress, i.e. before it gets queued etc. This will give better performance as unnecessary traffic will filtered at ingress. 

### 3.3.5 MCLAG Domain State
To support applications running over MCLAG, MCLAG domain states such as ICCP state, Active and Standby role, system MAC, and remote MCLAG interface state are populated in the STATE_DB for applications to consume.

### 3.3.6 Unique IP Changes
To support Unique IP configuration on VLAN interface for the VLAN's associated with MCLAG interface following changes will be done.
- In Standby node, disable Active node's MAC programming into MY Station TCAM. Also disable updating VLAN interface MAC in kernel.
- Add code to Sync VLAN interface MAC between Peers and program L2 Table with Peers VLAN interface MAC pointing to Peer Link. This is required since MAC learning is disabled for Peer Link.
- Add code to do ARP/ND sync for Local VLAN interface IP. 

For MCLAG gateway functionality (Data path) Static Anycast Gateway or VRRP configuration will be mandatory.

### 3.3.7 Peer MCLAG node reboot/down handling

- MCLAG node to notify the peer MCLAG node when the node is going for a reboot. ICCPd code is extended to receive the ICCPd going down as part of the node reboot and notify the peer MCLAG node via a new TLV. 
- When Standby MCLAG node receives the Active going down as part of peer node reboot, Standby MCLAG node to delay the session going down while the Active MCLAG node is down to keep the MCLAG PortChannel's up. Active MCLAG node does not process the Standby MCLAG node reboot notification event received. 
- If the session is not up before the peer reboot timer expiry peer MCLAG node is assumed down and to trigger the MCLAG session down behavior. 

### 3.3.8 MCLAG system MAC changes

In the current implementation, during the creation of MCLAG domain the local system MAC address is passed to ICCPd by mclagSyncd.  In the Active MCLAG node the same MAC is used in LACP PDU's, Active MCLAG node sync the local system MAC address to peer Standby MCLAG node. Standby MCLAG node uses the Active MCLAG node system MAC in LACP PDU's. 

When user configures the MCLAG system MAC address,  the MCLAG system MAC is used in LACP PDU's for MCLAG port channels,  following changes are implemented in ICCPd.

- ICCPd code enhanced to handle the new CLI for the MCLAG system MAC configuration.  

- Update the new MCLAG system MAC address for all the MCLAG portChannels both in Active and Standby MCLAG peer nodes. When PortChannel is deleted as member of MCLAG then update the PortChannel to use the local system MAC for LACP. 

- Update the STATE_DB with the MCLAG system MAC.

- On Standby MCLAG node ICCPd is enhanced to update the PortChannel state during session down while peer_link is up to disable MCLAG PortChannels to avoid traffic loop and duplicates . When ICCP session is back up ICCPd enables the PortChannels back up. STATE_DB introduces new MCLAG local interface table with a flag to indicate to disable the PortChannel. TeamMgr processed the updates and enables and disables the PortChannel state accordingly. 

### 3.3.9 MCLAG Gateway MAC changes
To support MCLAG gateway MAC configuration on VLAN interface for which peer link is member port following changes will be done.
- On gateway MAC configuration update Vlan interface MAC in kernel.
- On gateway MAC configuration update MY Station TCAM in Hardware.
- Do not update the Vlan interface MAC for the interface those have Unique IP configured.
- On removing gateway MAC configuration restore the default behaviour.

## 3.4 Switch State Service Design

### 3.4.1 Orchestration Agent

#### 3.4.1.1 Isolation group orch agent

A new isolation group orch agent will be added. Isolation group orch agent is the consumer of ISOLATION_GROUP_TABLE in APP DB.  MclagSyncd will produce the isolation group configuration in the APP DB and isolation group will program it in the ASIC DB. Only bridge port isolation group will be supported and will be used by MclagSyncd.

#### 3.4.1.2 PortsOrch Changes

To allow ICCP to control when traffic should be enabled on a LAG interface, PortsOrch is extended to support a new traffic disable attribute. When traffic disable attribute is set to true, LAG members are not added to hardware. They are kept in a temporary set until the traffic disable attribute is set to false.  


#### 3.4.1.3 FdbOrch Changes

As part of enhancements MclagSyncd populates the ICCP learned MAC addresses into the APP_DB MCLAG_FDB_TABLE instead of populating to APP_FDB_TABLE, FdbOrch registers to APP_DB MCLAG_FDB_TABLE to process the MAC updates from ICCP. 

Advertised FDB cache entries will now be marked about the learn source, MAC entries learned from APP_DB MCLAG_FDB_TABLE will be marked as learned from ICCP, these MAC addresses will be updated to ASIC_DB FDB_TABLE with new SAI attributes.

Advertised FDB entries with type static will be programmed to HW similar to local static MAC addresses to avoid any dynamic MAC move to other interfaces. 

When a static MAC address is configured locally and same MAC address is learned as advertised, FdbOrch to discard moving the MAC address. When static MAC address is deleted FdbOrch to re-program the advertised MAC address to HW. 

If the ICCP learned MAC is static, then any dynamic MAC move will be discarded by FdbOrch.

#### 3.4.1.4 MCLAG ARP MAC update to Kernel

ARP entries present in the system will need the associated MAC entries to be programmed in kernel to allow the local system and applications to reach the associated IP address. When ICCP receives a MAC update, if an ARP entry is associated with the MAC address then the MAC address needs to be programmed in kernel.  FdbOrch notifies NeighborOrch when MAC is learned via ICCP and NeighborOrch updates the MCLAG_ARP_FDB_TABLE in STATE_DB accordingly. FDBSyncd subscribes to this table and programs the kernel as required. A similar path is used to update kernel MAC entry If there is an interface change associated with the MAC or when the MAC address is deleted. 

Below Diagram show the remote ICCP MAC update to Kernel.

![MCLAG ARP MAC kernel update Diagram](images/MclagArpFdbKernelUpdate.png "MCLAG ARP interested MAC kernel programming Flow")

**Figure 2: MCLAG ARP interested MAC kernel programming Flow**

## 3.5 SyncD
No change to SyncD

## 3.6 MclagSyncD
### 3.6.1 FDB Changes
MclagSyncd is extended to optimize the FDB events handling. 

The changes include: -

- sending local MAC updates to ICCPd from STATE_DB FDB_TABLE instead of ASIC_DB FDB_TABLE
- sending of the MAC entries is event driven instead of the periodic 60 seconds polling
- removal of the FDB cache in the MclagSyncd
- adding the ICCP learned MAC addresses to APP_DB MCLAG_FDB_TABLE

#### 3.6.1.1 Local MAC upstream using STATE_DB FDB_TABLE
To distribute the local MAC addresses to ICCPd MclagSyncd will now listen for the STATE_DB FDB_TABLE updates. Current approach of periodic MAC table retrieval by polling and compare to find the MAC latest updates is costly in the scale scenarios. In the new approach STATE_DB FDB_TABLE MAC processing is event driven at MclagSyncd and no periodic polling is done.

#### 3.6.1.2 Removal of FDB table in MclagSyncd
With the above change to event-driven updates, MclagSyncd no longer needs a local FDB table copy - it can update directly between ICCPd and FdbOrch.

#### 3.6.1.3 Populating ICCP MAC updates to APP_DB MCLAG_FDB_TABLE

In current implementation MclagSyncd updates the MAC addresses into the existing APP_DB FDB_TABLE. In this enhancement, a new APP_DB MCLAG_FBD_TABLE is used. This allows clients to distinguish between local and remote (ICCP received) MAC address.

#### 3.6.1.4 Populating ICCP and MCLAG interface state information

MclagSyncd is extended to receive the ICCP session related information from ICCPd and to populate this information in STATE_DB STATE_MCLAG_TABLE. MclagSyncd also receives MCLAG remote interface information which is populated in STATE_DB STATE_MCLAG_REMOTE_INTF_TABLE.

### 3.6.2 MCLAG config handling
MclagSyncd will be enhanced to listen to CONFIG_DB changes in MCLAG domain table and MCLAG_INTF_TABLE and notify ICCPd. ICCPd is enhanced to process the configuration and handle config changes accordingly.

MclagSyncd to handle the MCLAG system MAC configuration updates for MCLAG PortChannels use. MclagSyncd to update the Local interface table along with port channel disable flag when session is down. TeamMgr to listen for the state updates and disable/enable the PortChannel admin state.



## 3.7 SAI
### 3.7.1 Port Isolation
The following SAI definitions will be used and no enhancements necessary

- https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saiisolationgroup.h

### 3.7.2 Gateway MAC
Existing SAI attribute SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_SRC_MAC_ADDRESS is used to update the MAC.

- MCLAG debug guide can be referred for trouble shooting issues. Below is the link to debug guide.

  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1exNQ1po7TYmVtctq59aSUeBsZYKctbHMkwStNVNgSrU/edit 

# 6 Warm Boot Support
- After a warm boot is completed, the FDB table is reconciled with the MCLAG peer. ICCP is extended to advertise the local FDB table. 

# 7 Scalability
- Support scale of 40K MAC addresses. 

# 8 Upgrade/Downgrade considerations

As part of the current enhancements MCLAG configuration can be provisioned dynamically, MclagSyncd reads the MCLAG  configuration from CONFIG_DB and updates to ICCPd.  The older way of  reading the configuration from configdb.json file during the ICCPd startup is deprecated.

Upgrade/downgrade from/to the older version is not supported with new enhanced version. 

# 9 Unit Test

## 9.1 DB table updates
1. Verify that MCLAG configuration of add/delete is updated in CONFIG_DB MCLAG Domain table.
2. Verify that mclag_interface configuration add/delete is updated properly in CONFIG_DB MCLAG interface table.
3. Verify that keep-alive and session-timeout values are updated properly in CONFIG_DB table.
4. Verify that MAC address updates received from peer MCLAG nodes is updated to APP MCLAG FDB table.
5. Verify that ICCP session state information is updated to STATE_MCLAG_TABLE.
6. Verify that MCLAG interface state information is updated to STATE_MCLAG_REMOTE_INTF_TABLE
7. Verify that Unique IP configuration if add/delete is updated in CONFIG_DB MCLAG UNIQUEIP TABLE

## 9.2 FDB

1. Verify that MAC address learned locally on orphan port are synced to the peer MCLAG node. 
2. Verify that MAC address aged locally on orphan ports are withdrawn to peer MCLAG node.
3. Verify that MAC address learned locally on MCLAG portchannel are synced to the peer MCLAG node. 
4. Verify that MAC address aged locally on MCLAG portchannel ports are withdrawn to peer MCLAG node.
5. Verify that when MCLAG portchannel is down MAC addresses pointing to the MCLAG portchannel are updated to point to peer-link interface.
6. Verify that when MClag portchannel is up MAC addresses pointing to peer-link interface are updated to point to MCLAG portchannel.
7. Verify that when peer-link is down MAC addresses pointing to peer-link are deleted on both the MCLAG peer nodes.
8. Verify that when clear FDB is executed local MAC addresses are cleared locally and withdrawn to the peer MCLAG node. Relearn the MAC addresses and advertise to peer MCLAG node.
9. Verify that static MAC configured locally is advertised to peer MCLAG node.
10. Verify that static MAC deleted locally is withdrawn to peer MCLAG node. 
11. Verify that in presence of remote static MAC addresses any dynamic local MAC move is not allowed.
12. Verify MAC learn with scale of 40K MAC entries.  

## 9.3 Config handling

1. Verify MCLAG domain configuration with local, peer ip, peer interface, MCLAG interface configures ICCP
2. Verify adding MCLAG interface to existing MCLAG domain  
3. Verify deleting one MCLAG interface from existing MCLAG domain  
4. Verify modifying local ip configuration for an existing MCLAG domain
5. Verify modifying peer interface for given MCLAG domain 
6. Verify configuration change of MCLAG keep-alive timer value to min/max values are reflected
7. Verify configuration change of MCLAG session timeout value to min/max values are reflected
8. Verify deletion of existing MCLAG domain
9. Verify adding MCLAG domain without peer interface
10. Verify adding MCLAG peer interface later after adding MCLAG domain
11. Verify deleting MCLAG interfaces with synced up MAC addresses and make sure behavior is similar to having MCLAG interface down
12. Verify Unique IP configuration on VLAN interface

## 9.4 Port Isolation

1. Configure Port Isolation group with members apply it to ingress port. Send unicast and BUM traffic and verify traffic is not seen at any member ports.
2. Dynamically add and delete the Port Isolation group members and verify unicast and BUM traffic again.
3. Remove Port Isolation group from ingress interface and verify traffic unicast and BUM again.
4. Send traffic from interface which doesn't have any port isolation group attached and verify unicast and BUM traffic.

## 9.5 MCLAG Interface Flap

1. Verify traffic is disabled until interface up ack is received from remote MCLAG peer when MCLAG interface flaps
2. Verify traffic is re-enabled on MCLAG interface which is waiting for interface up ack from peer when ICCP goes down
3. Verify traffic is disabled on a port when it is added to a MCLAG interface which is waiting for interface up ack from peer
4. Verify traffic is re-enabled on a LAG interface when it is unconfigured as MCLAG interface
5. Verify mclagdctl dump local interface output shows traffic is disabled on MCLAG interface which is waiting for interface up ack from peer

## 9.6 MCLAG Unique IP enhancements
1. Verify ARP and ND Sync.
2. Verify IPv4 and IPv6 routing with traffic
3. Veirfy Ping / Ping6 between Peer nodes VLAN interface
4. Veirfy Ping / Ping6 between Peer node VLAN interface and MCLAG Client device
5. Verify BGP session up on VLAN interface

## 9.7 MCLAG system MAC
1. Verify the configuration of MCLAG system MAC address add/delete. 
2. Verify that MCLAG PortChannels are UP on both the MCLAG nodes using MCLAG system MAC.
3. Verify that the user configured MCLAG system MAC takes precedence and used in LACP packets for MCLAG portChannels over local system MAC. 
4. Verify that Standby MCLAG node disables the MCLAG PortChannels when session is down when MCLAG system MAC is in use.
5. Verify that MCLAG PortChannels do not flap during session down and Active node reboot.
6. Verify that when MCLAG member deletes from from MCLAG domain the system MAC is used instead of the MCLAG system MAC in LACP.

## 9.8 MCLAG Gateway MAC

1. Verify gateway MAC configuration in both Active and Standby node.
2. Verify IPv4 and IPv6 routing with configured MAC as Gateway MAC.
3. Verify default behavior is restored on removing gateway MAC configuration.
4. Verify no traffic drop during failover scenario with gateway MAC configuration.
